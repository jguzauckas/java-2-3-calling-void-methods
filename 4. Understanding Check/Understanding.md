# Understanding Check

In `Understanding.java`, perform each of the following:

- Create a `Person` that is a student and is 54.5 inches tall and save it to a variable.
- Print out whether that person is a student and their height.
- Create a `Person` with the age 15 and save it to a variable.
- Print out all of the information about this person.
- Create a `Person` with age 60, a height of 61 inches and was born in 1962 and save it to a variable.
- Print out all of the information about this person.

Your goal is the eliminate the errors (highlighted in red) and instead ensure there is only warnings (highlighted in yellow), as that means there are no data type issues, just issues with the variables not being used further.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
